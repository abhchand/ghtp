sync:
  # A series of rules that define sync behavior between github labels and TargetProcess
  # states. Example:
  #
  # - if_has: Reviewable
  #   then_set: Code Review
  #
  # Translates to "If a Github PR has the label 'Reviewable', ensure the corresponding
  # TargetProcess entity is set to the 'Code Review' state
  #
  # Each Pull Request can only be targeted by up to 1 rule below, and they are applied
  # in the order below. The first matching rule dictates the state.
  #
  # Pull Requests must *opt in* to being synchronized with TargetProcess. Only those
  # Pull requests starting with "[TP#XXXX]" (where "XXXX" is the TargetProcess entity
  # ID) will be synchronized.
